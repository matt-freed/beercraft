				<p>As a craft beer nerd and homebrewer I wanted to make a tool to help
				create and keep track of my homebrew recipes. I wanted it to be web based
				and responsive so I could use it on my phone or tablet as a reference on brew day
				and while shopping for ingredients. As a software developer this seemed like a 
				perfect opportunity for a small side project which became Beercraft!

				<b>Developer Info</b>
				<p>Developer: Matt Freed (matt@mattfreed.net)</p>
				<p>This app was written in the AngularJS framework with Bootstrap. The back end REST services
				are JAX-RS Java based which provide access (through Hibernate) to the MySQL database that houses the ingredients and recipes.
				Google OAuth is used to provide authentication. The ingredient data itself is provided by the open 
				source desktop app Brewtarget (http://www.brewtarget.org/).</p>
				<p>I plan to release the source code on github soon.</p>
