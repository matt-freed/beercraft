				<p>Beercraft is a simple app to create and store your homebrew recipes and
				access them wherever you go.  
				<hr/>
				<b>Sign In</b>
				<p>Signing in to the app is optional. You may still create recipes and compare the 
				output parameters to the style you are targeting. However,
				if you sign you will be able to save your recipes.</p>
				<p>To sign in, click on the Sign In option in the nav bar. Sign in is done through your Google
				account. We only use your email to keep track of your recipes.</p>
				<hr/>
				
				<b>Recipe Edit</b>
				<p>The Recipe Edit page is where you create recipes. Give it your batch size, boil time, and the
				ingredients you will add and it will calculate the parameters (Gravity, ABV %, IBU, etc) of your
				recipe. Select a style and you can compare your results to see if you meet the style ranges. Rows will
				highlight yellow when you have gone outside the style window.</p>
				<p>There is also a Brew Log tab to keep track of how your recipe actually turned out. The Generate Schedule
				button will use your fermentation schedule to mark the transfer days out in the future and determine when your beer
				will be ready. If you enter in your actual gravities and final volume size it will calculate your efficiencies.</p>
				<hr/>
				
				<b>Browse Recipes</b>
				<p>If you are signed in, you can view the recipes you have saved. Selecting a row brings you to the recipe edit page.</p>
				<hr/>
				
				<b>Ingredients/Styles</b>
				<p>View the ingredients and styles in our database. Sort by clicking on a header and search by using the search box. Selecting
				a row brings up more detailed information.</p>
